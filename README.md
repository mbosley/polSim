# polSim: Population Simulation Platform for Social Science Research

## Overview
`polSim` is a platform designed for simulating synthetic populations in social science research. The platform leverages large language models to generate populations with user-defined attributes, facilitating a broad range of simulations from simple surveys to complex behavioral studies.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: System components are designed for easy updates and scalability.
- **Population Representation**: Agents are represented as individual `.txt` files within a structured directory.
- **Attribute Customization**: Users can define attribute categories, options, and sampling methods.
- **Population Size Flexibility**: Supports simulation of varying population sizes according to research needs.
- **Task Segregation**: Profiles are independent from tasks, allowing for versatile simulation workflows.
- **Configuration**: Both manual and GPT-assisted configuration methods are available.
- **Interface Options**: Includes a command line interface with plans for a future graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Open Source**: Hosted on GitHub for community collaboration.
- **Model Compatibility**: Compatible with OpenAIâ€™s API, High-Performance Computing (HPC) models, or local models.

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```
git clone [repository-url]
cd polSim
```
Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
Configuration is managed via a global YAML file. This file specifies attribute categories, options, population sizes, and other simulation parameters.

## Usage
To start a simulation, use the following command:
```
python simulate.py --config path/to/config.yaml
```

Replace `path/to/config.yaml` with the path to your configuration file.

### Defining Attributes
Edit the `config.yaml` to specify the attributes of the population you want to simulate. The configuration structure is as follows:
```
attributes:
  age:
    type: range
    min: 18
    max: 65
  occupation:
    type: categorical
    options:
      - Student
      - Employed
      - Unemployed
      - Retired
```

### Generating Population
To generate a population, run:
```
python generate_population.py
```
This will create a population of agents with attributes defined in your `config.yaml`.
